        <h2 class="section-buzz">Our program is comprised of <span>passionate students</span> committed to improving lives abroad through <span>creative</span> and <span>sustainable</span> engineering <span>solutions</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>The Columbia University chapter of Engineers Without Borders aims to address the problems facing people 
                both locally and overseas by leveraging the skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University 
                students and the sponsorships formed with our organization. Our members come from many different 
                arts, sciences, and engineering backgrounds, who collectively share a desire to do meaningful 
                work and make a difference.</p>
            <p>The chapter currently consists of three programs in Ghana, Uganda, and Morocco.  
                The <a href="http://ghana.cuewb.org/" target="_blank">Ghana program</a>, 
                which started in 2004, used to work in the semi-urban town of Sakyikrom but 
                now focuses on water management in the farming community of Obodan. In 2008, 
                the <a href="http://uganda.cuewb.org" target="_blank">Uganda program</a> was 
                established to install a Multi-Function Energy Platform in the Soroti region.  
                The Morocco program, which began in 2011, finished building a <a href="#bridge">bridge</a> 
                in the rural community of Ait Bayoud in June 2013 and is now and is now working 
                on providing safe and easily accessible drinking water directly to the communities 
                of Izgouaren and Ilguiloda through a water sourcing and distribution system.  
                Each project draws from the skills of its members to provide technical solutions to worldwide 
                problems.</p>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle"><span>Ait Bayoud</span>, a rural Moroccan community in the Essaouira region, 
            experiences <span>seasonal flooding</span> of its central Tagawowt river that <span>disrupts access</span> to the local <span>health clinic</span>, <span>school</span>, and <span>markets</span> for hundreds of residents.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">The <span>Morocco program</span> of Columbia's EWB-USA chapter began in 2011 when Nina Morency-Brassard, a Columbia alumna and Peace Corps volunteer stationed in Ait Bayoud, reached out to our chapter with a collaborative <span>project proposal</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>To address the flooding of the Tagawowt river, the community suggested a bridge project to EWB-USA CU so 
                that the river could be safely and consistently crossed during the rainy season. Along with professional
                structural engineers, various Peace Corps volunteers, and a host of community leaders and workers in Ait 
                Bayoud, the students of the Morocco project have worked to fund, design, and source materials for the 
                implementation of a 210ft suspension footbridge.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2011 and the winter of 2012, two assessment teams gathered technical data and determined
                a bridge site. In the summer of 2012, implementation of the bridge began. Over the course of 6 weeks, our 
                team of students and professional mentors worked alongside local workers in Ait Bayoud to clear and prepare
                the bridge sites, mix and pour the concrete foundations and towers, and install each of the bridge's main
                cables. In the winter of 2013, we sent a team to assess the state of the bridge, and in the summer we sent 
                two final project teams. They tensioned the bridge cables, installed decking, and completed the project. 
                Following the bridge’s completion in June 2013, CU-EWB Morocco has maintained and improved the completed 
                footbridge, performing extensive inspections every six months and successfully pre-tensioning a new rope 
                in the summer of 2017. Teams have recently focused on fully transitioning ownership and maintenance of 
                the bridge to the community, creating a useful picture-based guide and facilitating community-led bridge
                inspections.</p>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">The members of <span>Izgouaren</span>, one of a series of dwars or neighborhood 
            clusters that make up Ait Bayoud, spend up to <span>4 hours a day</span> walking <span>to get water</span>.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">While assessing the community of Ait Bayoud during her Peace Corps Service, Nina 
            noticed another <span>pressing issue</span> to the <span>quality of life</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>Ait Bayoud consists of a series of dwars, or neighborhood clusters, that are staggered along the river. 
                Izgouaren, a dwar isolated on a raised plateau, suffers from limited access to water. Every day, 
                families walk back and forth down to the river to gather water from a nearby spring, spending about an 
                hour per trip and making up to 3 trips a day.</p>
            <p>To address this issue, a team consisting of Columbia students as well as Peace Corps Volunteers 
                visited Izgouaren in January 2014 and began to assess the dwar's needs, the river conditions, and 
                Ait Bayoud's current water sourcing status. We sent one additional assessment travel team in the summer 
                of 2014 to measure the flow rate of multiple springs and the river near Izgouaren, to determine a 
                piping path to transport water to the dwars, and to perform water quality tests on the sources of water. 
                Using the information collected during the two assessment trips, the winter 2015 team returned and 
                successfully constructed a shallow well along the river.</p>
            <p>As of summer 2019 we have constructed a concrete water storage tank, installed solar panels to power
                a pump at the well, and laid approximately 4km of HDPE pipeline between the wellsite, concrete tank and
                the Ilguiloda dwar, which lies between the pipeline and Izgouaren. Tap stands accessible by the Ilguiloda
                community have also been constructed. The COVID-19 pandemic precluded in-person implementation in the 
                summer of 2020, which led us to focus on community development and building relationships with local 
                organizations. Extension of the pipeline from Ilguiloda to Izgouaren is postponed until travel restrictions 
                are lifted. Additionally, we intend to construct two more tanks, one as a break pressure and the other a 
                storage tank including a slow sand filter, and construct tap stands to ensure all community members have 
                access to the water. </p>
